# TODO

- Add more utility functions to base langauge.  For sustainability we may make these registered external functions that get registered by default.   
    - Math: POW, ABS, TAN, SIN, COS 
    - String: LEN
    - Random: RND
- Array support
- Outside in functional calling.  IE Go code calls a specific function in the script like `update()` or `handleHit()`
